The Mobile App is an extension of WorkBC Online Employment Services (OES) which provides secure messaging between clients and their WorkBC Centres, as well as client case details and the ability to apply for additional services. The Mobile App also provides access to search the WorkBC.ca job board, where search results and individual job postings can be saved to the app, and clients can directly apply for jobs via WorkBC.ca job links.</p>
